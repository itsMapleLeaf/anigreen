## core

- media cards
  - [x] design
  - bookmark button
    - [x] when logged out, show an auth required message in a modal or tooltip
    - when logged in
      - [x] if not on list, show bookmark icon, add to bookmarks on click
      - if on list, show edit menu icon to show a popover
        - [x] hold
        - [x] drop
        - [x] remove
        - [x] rate
        - [x] set progress -> + and - buttons with an input
  - [x] links button, pops a menu on open, lists all the media external links
  - [x] advance progress button
    - only show when on list and when progress is not 100%
    - advance progress by 1 on click
  - [x] show progress somewhere
  - [x] show watching status (watching, completed, on hold, dropped)
- [x] schedule page
- watching page
  - [x] "In progress" section, for items that aren't completed
  - [x] watching items sectioned by weekday + "not airing"
  - [x] hide watching status - they're all "watching", so it's redundant to show it
- [x] deal with timezone difference between server and client
  - just using a fixed time zone for now. a setting can come later, and/or some client-side redirect to set the timezone
- [ ] make a new logo/favicon in figma
  - the a and g in light font on top of a blue-gray rounded square

## ideas

- [ ] currently, the arrow keys for pagination prevent using the arrow keys for other things, like radio inputs. need to figure something out for this
- [ ] recently aired section on watching
- [ ] show a pretty banner on the user menu, like in anigreen fly
- [ ] my list - a page which lists your full anime list
- settings
  - general
    - [ ] media title format
    - [ ] time zone
  - schedule
    - [ ] adult
    - [ ] country of origin
    - [ ] licensed
- [ ] search page
- [ ] show a loading spinner in a corner while loading or navigating
- [ ] click on a cover/banner to view the full image in a lightbox modal (or just in a new tab lol)
- [ ] media card: show full title in tooltip
- [ ] add route error boundary for loader errors
- [ ] add modals for action errors
- [x] make the header transparent black on scroll, solid when at top
- [ ] pagination: button to go back to first page
- [ ] notification/toast to undo an accidental action
- [ ] consider using text instead of tooltips for media card actions
- [ ] schedule infinite scrolling
  - this has an official example we can follow now
  - probably needs perf optimization???
- [ ] add max value on progress and score inputs
- [ ] handle "completed" status properly
  - "completed" means when mediaListEntry.progress === media.episodeCount
  - show "completed" on media cards
  - disable the status input on the edit modal, send completed status on submit
- [ ] use apollo client for fetch parallelization and caching
