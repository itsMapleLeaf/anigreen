AniList works well as a generic searchable filterable database, but I wanted to make a new experience around it catering to a specific kind of person: those who like to follow anime that airs from season to season, and seeing which anime airs on which days of the week, with an easy way to track what they've watched.

If you're like me, anigreen might be for you! âœ¨
